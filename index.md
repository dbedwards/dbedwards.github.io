## Resistors
A resistor is an electrical component. It uses resistance as an element of a circuit. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, and divide voltages. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust parts of a circuit (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer).
