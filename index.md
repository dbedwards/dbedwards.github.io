## Resistors
A resistor is an electric component that slows down current. The amount it slows the current down by is called _resistance_. Fixed resistors have resistances that don't change. Variable resistors can be used to adjust parts of a circuit (like volume control or a lamp dimmer).

## Capacitors
A capacitor stores energy, and how much it can store is called capacitance. A capacitor adds capacitance to a circuit. Most capacitors have two leads. When voltage goes across the terminals of a capacitor, like when a capacitor is connected across a battery, an electric field forms. That field is just energy stored for later.

## LEDs
An LED is a light that turns on when electricity goes through it. You can get LEDs in lots of different colors. LEDs are better than normal lights because they use less energy, they last longer, and they're a lot smaller. LEDs are used in airplanes, headlamps, traffic lights, and cameras, among many things.

## Transistors
A transistor is used either to make signals bigger, or to switch them. It's usually made of silicon and has three terminals, so it can connect to a circuit. A current on one terminal controls the current through another terminal. Since the output power can be higher than the input power, a transistor can amplify a signal.
