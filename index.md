## Resistors
A resistor is an electrical component. It uses resistance as an element of a circuit. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, and divide voltages. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust parts of a circuit (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer).

## Capacitors
A capacitor stores energy in an electric field. What a capacitor does is called capacitance. A capacitor is a component designed to add capacitance to a circuit. Most capacitors have two leads. When voltage goes across the terminals of a capacitor, like when a capacitor is connected across a battery, an electric field forms across the dielectric, making a positive charge on one plate and a negative charge on the other plate. No current actually flows through the dielectric, but charge does go through the circuit that the capacitor is in. If the condition stays long enough, the current in the circuit stops. If a changing voltage goes across the leads of the capacitor, a current happens because of the cycles of the capacitor.

## LEDs
A light-emitting diode, or LED, is a light source that shows light when current flows through it. Now, LEDs are available in wavelengths for visible, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared wavelengths. LEDs have lots of advantages over incandescent lights, like lower energy consumption, longer lifetime, and smaller size. LEDs are used in things like airplane lights, car headlamps, advertising, normal lighting, traffic lights, and camera flashes.

## Transistors
A transistor is a device used to amplify or switch electronic signals. It's made of a semiconductor and usually has three terminals, so it can connect to a circuit. A current on one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Since the output power can be higher than the input power, a transistor can amplify a signal.
